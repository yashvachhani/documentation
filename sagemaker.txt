#Amazon sagemaker 

    amazon sagemaker is a fully managed machine learning service that developers and data scientists can use to build train and deploy machine learning models.

    # notebook instances

        with the notebook instances on sagemaker it all starts with a notebook right and within the notebook it starts with your EC2 instance your EC2 instance that's your it Elastic compute cloud
        that is your virtual machine, that is gonna spin up and let us do all of our processing this is a managed EC2 instance that means that even though we are turning it on and off it is not gonna show
        up under our EC2 console and we are not gonna have SSH access to this machine 

        # create your notebook instance

            # i pick the right family
                ex: {t, m, c, p}
                    t = tiny
                    m = midium (slieyt larger then tiny)
                    c = comput optimised
                    p = gpu

            # Pick the right size 
                ex: medium -> very, very large

            # Pick the right version  
                ex: ml.t3.medium

        # add an EBS Volume

            # pick the right size
                5 GB default

            # think: store on EBS
                /home/es2-user/Sagemaker

            # add or create git repository

            # configure security settings
                encryption
                root Volume access
                internet access
                VPC connection

            # Use a Lifecycle configuration
                Create, start notebook
                install packages, copy data
                Run in background with '&'

            # optional attach a portion of a GPU for local inference
                size, version, bandwidth

# IAM (identity & access management):

    where you manage who has access to your AWS account, and what AWS resources they can use.

    # what is IAM

        IAM is where you manage your AWS users and their access to AWS accounts and services.

        IAM is commonly used to manage:
            users
            Groups
            IAM Access Policies
            Roles

        Note: the user created when you created the AWS account is Called the "root" user.

        By default, the root user has full administrative rights and acess to every part of the account.

        By default, any new user you create in the AWS account are created with no access to any AWS services.

        for all users (besides the root user), permissions must be given that grant access to AWS services.

    # IAM Setup

        AWS Best Practices: GUidelines that recommend settings, configurations, and architecture for maintaining a high level of security, accessibility, and efficiency.

        when a new AWS root account is created, it is best practice to complete the tasks listed in IAM under Security Status.

        These tasks include:

            Delete your root access keys

            Activate MFA(multi-factor authenition) on your root account

                MFA is an abbreviation for multi-factor authenition
                
                MFA is an aditional layer of security on your root account that is provided by a third party.

                it provides you a continually-changing, random, six-digit code that you will need to input(along with your password) when logging into your root account.

                # how do i get the MAF code?
                    
                    virtual MAF Device:

                        smartphone or tablet

                        commonly used app: google authenition

                    hardware key fob:

                        small physical Device woth a display that you can attach to your keychain

                        ordered directly from aws

            Create individual IAM users
            
                AWS best practice is to never use your account for day-to-day use

                if you want full admin access, create an IAM uasr and attach the administratoraccess policy to it

                use that account as your daily driver

            Use groups to assign permissions

                an IAM group is a collection of IAM users. Groups allow you to set and manage permissions for multipleusers at the same time.

                groups are a more convenient and efficient way to manage account permissions. For example if our user james were to switch positions within the company, we could easily remove james from his old group and add him to new groups.

            Apply an IAM passwors policy

                a password policy dictates the format and expiration rules that a user must follow when creating or modifying their password.

                these rules include:

                    length requirements

                    case requirements

                    number requirements

                    non-alphanumeric requirements
                    
                    password expiration

                    password reuse

                    user rights to change their own password

                    administrator reset requirements

    # IAM users and policies

        IAM is commonly used to manage:

            users

            groups

            IAM Access Policies

                have you completed the project omega infrastructure requirements for this section?

                    an AWS account

                    user accounts for the development team with access to core AWS services:

                        three IAM user accounts one for each member of the dev team

                        an IAM group for the dev team

                        IAM policies attached to the groups granting access to S3, EC2, and records

                    test the possibility of using Serverless technology for project omega 


            Roles

                Roles are for instance to use other service

                like EC2 instance want some data that stored in S3 bucket 

                at that time we specify roles that gives EC2 instance access to use S3 bucket

# VPC (virtual private cloud):

    a private sub-section of AWS that you control, which you can place AWS resourses, like EC2 instances and databases

    AWS global infrastructure (AWS availability Zones):

        geographically isolated Zones within a region that house resources

        availability Zones are where separate, physical AWS data centers are located

        multiple AZs in each region provide redundancy for AWS resources in that region

    what is a VPC?

        simplified Definition:

            it is a private subsection of AWS that you control, into which you can place AWS resources(such as EC2 instances and databases). you have full control over who has access to the AWS resources that you place inside your VPC.

        AWS Definition:

            "Amazon Virtual Private Cloud(Amazon VPC) lets you provision a logically isolated section of the amazon web service of the amazon web service(AWS) cloud where you launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. you have complete control over your virtual networking environment including selection of your own IP address range. creation of subnets and configuration of route tablels and network gateways"

    what is an IGW(Internet Gateways)?

        simplified Definition:
        
            A combination of hardware and software that provides your private network with a route to the world outside (meaning the internet) of the VPC

        AWS Definition:

            "an internet gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant and highly available VPC component that allows communication between instance in your VPC and the internet it therefore inposes no availability risks or bandwidth constraints on your network traffic."

    what is a Route Tables?

        AWS Definition:

            "A route table contains a set of rules. called routes. that are used to determine where network traffic is directed"

    what is a NACL?

        AWS Definition:

            "A network access control list (NACL) is an optional layer of security for your VPC that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more subnets."

    what is a subnets?

        AWS Definition:

            "When you create a VPC, it spans all of the availability Zones in the region. After creating a VPC. you can add one or more subnets in each Availability Zone Each subnet must reside entirely when one availability Zone and cannot span zones."

     
# S3 (simple storage service):

    a bulk storage service where you can store any type of file 

# EC2 (Elastic Cloud Compute):

    Basically a virtual computer, very similar to the dasktop or laptop computer you use at home. and commonly referred to as an instance.

    what is EC2?

        amazon Definition:

            "Amazon Elastic compute cloud(Amazon EC2) provides scalable computing capacity in the amazon web services(AWS) cloud. using amazon EC2 eliminates your need to invest in hardware up front. so you can develop and deploy applixations faster. you can use amazon EC2 to launch as many or as many or as few virtual servers as you need. configure security and networking, and manage storage. amazon EC2 enables you to scale up or down to handle changes in requirements or spikes in popularity. reducing your need to forecast traffic."
            
# RBS (relational Database service):

    A database platform that uses mysql as its backbone

# DynamoDB:

    A database service that uses NoSQL as its backbone

# CloudWatch:

    An AWS service that allows fopr monitoring and viewing metrics on the performance of the other AWS services, such as an EC2 instance.

# ELB (Elastic Load Balancer):

    A tool that distributes incomming web traffic (i.e. visitors to a web site) and equally across multiple EC2 instances that are running a web site.

        helps preventone server from being overloaded while another server can handle more visitors.

# Auto Scaling:

    A tool that can automate the scale-up and scale-down of required EC2 instances based on traffic demands

# Route 53:

    an AWS service that allows management of website domains and DNS records.
